The ice cream truck is selling many food items: Ice Creams, Shaved Ice, and also Snack bars!
Each one of these food items has a price and a name.
An Ice cream has many flavors: Chocolate, Pistachio, Strawberry and Mint.
The Ice cream truck has a limited amount of Ice creams, Shaved ice and Chocolate bars of
course.
The ice cream truck has many customers. They come and buy a specific amount of food. Each
time they buy something, the truck owner should say "ENJOY!".
If they try to buy more than what the ice cream truck has in stock, then the ice cream truck
owner should respond with "SORRY!".
You'll build that ice cream truck as an API.
The API should have a simple endpoint to buy a specific food from the ice cream truck.
There should also be another endpoint that gives the inventory of the ice cream truck, and the
total amount of money the ice cream truck has made.
Feel free to add more endpoints you consider necessary for an ice cream truck with customers.
The quantity and price of each food item in the ice cream truck is up to you.
You'll make a simple test, so I can confirm it works easily.
Try to build it so that it's scalable, so when the ice cream truck gets famous they can open a
franchise and have many ice cream trucks!
